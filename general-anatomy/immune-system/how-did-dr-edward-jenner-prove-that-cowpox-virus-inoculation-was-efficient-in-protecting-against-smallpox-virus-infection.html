<title>How did Dr. Edward Jenner prove that cowpox virus inoculation was efficient in protecting against smallpox virus infection?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="To test his theory, Dr. Jenner took material from a cowpox sore on milkmaid Sarah Nelmes hand and inoculated it into the arm of James Phipps, the 9-year-old son of Jenners gardener. Months later, Jenner exposed Phipps several times to variola virus, but Phipps never developed smallpox.The first vaccination He diagnosed cowpox rather than smallpox and Sarah confirmed that one of her cows, a Gloucester cow called Blossom, had recently had cowpox. Edward Jenner realised that this was his opportunity to test the protective properties of cowpox by giving it to someone who had not yet suffered smallpox.Inorder to test his theory, Jenner injected a small dose of cowpox virus into a boy. Once he recovered, Jenner injected the boy with smallpox virus. He observed that the boy did not get the disease. This finding led to the discovery of the smallpox vaccine.After inoculation, vaccination using the cowpox virus became the primary defense against smallpox. After infection by the cowpox virus, the body (usually) gains the ability to recognize the similar smallpox virus from its antigens and is able to fight the smallpox disease much more efficiently.The smallpox vaccine, introduced by Edward Jenner in 1796, was the first successful vaccine to be developed. He observed that milkmaids who previously had caught cowpox did not catch smallpox and showed that inoculated vaccinia protected against inoculated variola virus.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-To test his theory, Dr. Jenner took material from a cowpox sore on milkmaid Sarah Nelmes’ hand and inoculated it into the arm of James Phipps, the 9-year-old son of Jenner’s gardener. Months later, Jenner exposed Phipps several times to variola virus, but Phipps never developed smallpox.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The first vaccination He diagnosed cowpox rather than smallpox and Sarah confirmed that one of her cows, a Gloucester cow called Blossom, had recently had cowpox. Edward Jenner realised that this was his opportunity to test the protective properties of cowpox by giving it to someone who had not yet suffered smallpox.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Inorder to test his theory, Jenner injected a small dose of cowpox virus into a boy. Once he recovered, Jenner injected the boy with smallpox virus. He observed that the boy did not get the disease. This finding led to the discovery of the smallpox vaccine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-After inoculation, vaccination using the cowpox virus became the primary defense against smallpox. After infection by the cowpox virus, the body (usually) gains the ability to recognize the similar smallpox virus from its antigens and is able to fight the smallpox disease much more efficiently.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The smallpox vaccine, introduced by Edward Jenner in 1796, was the first successful vaccine to be developed. He observed that milkmaids who previously had caught cowpox did not catch smallpox and showed that inoculated vaccinia protected against inoculated variola virus.
