<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Proteins are composed of amino acid subunits that form polypeptide chains. Enzymes catalyze biochemical reactions by speeding up chemical reactions, and can either break down their substrate or build larger molecules from their substrate. The shape of an enzymeâ€™s active site matches the shape of the substrate.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An enzyme is a biological catalyst and is almost always a protein. It speeds up the rate of a specific chemical reaction in the cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A protein molecule is made from a long chain of these amino acids, each linked to its neighbor through a covalent peptide bond (Figure 3-1). Proteins are therefore also known as polypeptides. Each type of protein has a unique sequence of amino acids, exactly the same from one molecule to the next.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Enzymes Enzymes are typically proteins (some nucleic acids have also been found to be enzymes) that act as catalysts, speeding up chemical reactions that would take a long time to occur on their own. Enzymes speed up the vast majority of the chemical reactions that occur in cells.
